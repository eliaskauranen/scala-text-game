# Scala Text Game: A Forest Nightmare

## Name: 
    A Forest Nightmare

## Description: 
    Code made by me for an individual school project assignment. The idea of the game is to escape a killer in the woods by finding car parts around the map, fix the car with the found parts, and drive away through one of the exits of the map. More details in the walkthrough file.
## Notes:
    This is my first bigger school coding assignment from my first university year. However, I added only the code made by me and left out all the code made by course staff. Therefore, the game cannot be run because necessary code is missing. This is unfortunate because this game is fun to play!
