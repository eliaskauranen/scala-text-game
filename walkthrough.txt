-Knife, Penknife and Pocketknife: You need them to survive the killers attack on you.
-Bandage and Firstaid: You need them to heal yourself if you're hurt because of the killers attack on you.
3. Stay alive. You die:
- If the killer attacks you and you neither have a knife item (knife, penknife, pocketknife) nor are you driving thye car. 
  You survive an attack with a knife but it will be removed. You also get hurt. If you are driving the car, it protects you from damage but you can't continue driving before the killer is elsewhere.
- If you have played 20 turns while you're hurt. You can heal yourself with bandage or firstaid item by using command heal. The used item will be removed.
